### Cat and Dog Classifier 🐱🐶

## Dataset 📂
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the popular Dogs vs. Cats dataset, which consists of labeled images of cats and dogs.Dataset is in Kaggle (datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats)

## Features ✨
📌 Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras
📌 Uses CNN architecture for feature extraction

## Training the Model 🏋️‍♂️
📊The dataset is split into training (80%) and validation (20%).
🏗️The model is trained using CNN layers with techniques like batch normalization and dropout.

## Results 🎯
📌 After training, the model achieves high accuracy in classifying cats and dogs, and its performance can be further improved by hyperparameter tuning and more complex architectures. # CODE FILES(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RslusB_iXyzemjtstnz_ttAcH_sgp0hC/view?usp=sharing) OR (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KDXqQb3ZiH81yYoIw71khD0aYp3fckou/view?usp=sharing)
